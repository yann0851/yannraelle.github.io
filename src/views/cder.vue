Indeed, some spread.net components were no longer compatible when the company's computers were upgraded to Windows 10, which is why we replaced them with more modern Telerik components. My main mission was then to clean these applications of these components, and  go through a graphic overhaul of these in order to include the new components.</p>

                      <p style="color: white;">Being my second internship within the CDER, I was looking for a totally different objective in order to see a maximum of choices made by the association. This is why the project entrusted to me this time was a web application. This app is a loan planner. The goal is simple, the user must be able to connect to his member account and see the evolution of his various loans over 10 years. Thanks to this, he can have an overview of these loans no matter where he is. We therefore thought of an easy-to-use visual web application so as not to lose him.</p>
