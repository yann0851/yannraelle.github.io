                    The enormous potential associated with medical data has led the healthcare industry to a significant and rapid transformation. As a result, the requirements for implementing improvements are becoming more and more significant. To move forward in the right direction, practitioners (physicians, nurses) and facility administrators need direct access to actionable information in medical data to improve performance and quality of care in measurable ways. The demand for actionable information from integrated medical data is growing. There is significant untapped information in patient flow, medical records, service tracking, cycle times, and facility profitability data waiting to be discovered.

First, we had to create a solution for integrating data from distributed files into a single persistent source using Talend. Then, we identified the needs of the users (practitioners, head of establishment) in terms of data analysis for direct exploitation on the follow-up of the patients at the national level and in the long term. </p>
