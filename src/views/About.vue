            <h5 class="mt-3" style="color: white;">Hello, my name is Yann Raelle, I am 21 years old and I am currently in my 3rd year of study at the Campus CESI engineering school in Reims. I really liked computers
              Since I was little, but at the time I preferred to tinker, touch a little bit of everything, it's only been a short time since I've been interested in development and computer engineering. This is
              why I have learned a lot since my arrival at CESI, both on the technical side and on the human side. Indeed the fact of rubbing shoulders with the world on a day-to-day basis, as well as my various internships,
              I was able to develop an ease in reaching out to others and exchanging with them. Today my professional goal is materializing, I am beginning to find my real orientation in the world of
              IT, what really interests me is project management, because I like this management side, much more than the technical side.

                            I had the chance to do my two CESI internships at the CDER in Chalons en Champagne. My first internship took place during my second year at CESI, I had the
                            chance to meet a great team of engineers there.
