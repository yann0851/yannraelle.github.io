The goal was therefore to receive trucks and fill them with the requested product, knowing that you should not make a mistake because there are several kinds of glucose. So I was trained, I was able to receive a lot of drivers, I then had to check the state of cleanliness of the tank and decide whether to load it or not.\r\n                          </p>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"row mt-3 border-top\">\r\n              <div class=\"container\">\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-2\">\r\n                      <h2 class=\"text-center\" style=\"color:white;\">Cleaning</h2>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n                      <div class=\"row\">\r\n                        <div class=\"col\"></div>\r\n                        <div class=\"col-6\">\r\n                            <img class=\"align-middle img-fluid\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/nettoyage.jpg\">\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"col\"></div>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div class=\"mt-3 row\">\r\n                          <p style=\"color: white;\">\r\n                              This second mission, carried out during the summer of 2020, was simpler, although more physical than one might think. Indeed, the goal was to clean all the parts of the factory that we were asked to do. To do this we used Karcher, vacuum cleaner .... This work helped me a lot to improve my teamwork, because to carry out the work days, we shared the tasks and managed our time ourselves.\r\n\r\n                          </p>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"row mt-3 border-top\">\r\n              <div class=\"container\">\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-2\">\r\n                      <h2 class=\"text-center\" style=\"color:white;\">Wheat reception</h2>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n                      <div class=\"row\">\r\n                        <div class=\"col\"></div>\r\n                        <div class=\"col-6\">\r\n                            <img class=\"align-middle img-fluid\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/blÃ©.jpg\">\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"col\"></div>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div class=\"mt-3 row\">\r\n                          <p style=\"color: white;\">\r\n                              I really liked this last job at ADM, because I really enjoyed it. Indeed this job gave me much more responsibility because after two weeks of training I had to manage an entire position alone. This position is the \"Wheat reception\", it is a very important position because wheat is the raw material that runs the whole factory, without wheat, the factory can no longer produce. In this position, I had to receive the trucks, control the quality of the wheat grains (moisture, size, protein), thanks to samples and then if the wheat passes the control, manage the unloading of it. To do this I had to manage both the driver who unloads, as well as the rest of my workshop in parallel (speed of the elevator, sieve...)\r\n                          </p>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n\r\n</style>","import { render } from \"./adm.vue?vue&type=template&id=c49aea8a\"\nimport script from \"./adm.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./adm.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Raelle Yann\\\\yannraelle.github.io\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader-v16\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
