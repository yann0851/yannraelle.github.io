Since its creation, the CDER activity has evolved, this evolution is linked to the development of management advice, and then accounting with the institution of VAT. Over time, CDER has become the preferred partner of business leaders, farmers, craftsmen, traders, service providers, VSEs-SMEs and liberal professions. Today the CDER is the largest Association of Management and Accounting in France because it has around 12,000 members and more than 700 employees. The CDER is known for its know-how and its methods acquired over many years as well as its mastery of accounting, tax, legal and social techniques. He is characterized by his skills which allow him to support his clients at any time in the life of a company.\r\n                  </h5>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div class=\"col-8\">\r\n                  <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"cder.jpg\">\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"row mt-3 border-top\">\r\n              <div class=\"container\">\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-2\">\r\n                      <h2 class=\"text-center\" style=\"color:white;\">Frais de déplacement</h2>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n                      <p style=\"color: white;\">The purpose of this first internship was to replace the components of certain applications developed internally by the company. Indeed, some spread.net components were no longer compatible when the company's computers were upgraded to Windows 10, which is why we replaced them with more modern Telerik components. My main mission was then to clean these applications of these components, and  go through a graphic overhaul of these in order to include the new components.</p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row\">\r\n                      <h3 class=\"text-center mt-3\" style=\"color: white;\">Skills acquired</h3>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n                      <div class=\"col align-middle\">\r\n                          <img class=\"mt-5 img-fluid\" src=\"sp-hex-net.png\">\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div class=\"col\">\r\n                          <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"Csharp.png\">\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div class=\"col mt-4\">\r\n                          <img class=\"mt-5 img-fluid\" src=\"telerik.png\">\r\n                      </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"row mt-3 border-top\">\r\n              <div class=\"container\">\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-2\">\r\n                      <h2 class=\"text-center\" style=\"color:white;\">Echéancier d'emprunts</h2>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n                      <p style=\"color: white;\">Being my second internship within the CDER, I was looking for a totally different objective in order to see a maximum of choices made by the association. This is why the project entrusted to me this time was a web application. This app is a loan planner. The goal is simple, the user must be able to connect to his member account and see the evolution of his various loans over 10 years. Thanks to this, he can have an overview of these loans no matter where he is. We therefore thought of an easy-to-use visual web application so as not to lose him.</p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row\">\r\n                      <h3 class=\"text-center mt-3\" style=\"color: white;\">Skills acquired</h3>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n                      <div class=\"col align-middle\">\r\n                          <img class=\" img-fluid\" src=\"Logo-Vuejs.png\">\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div class=\"col\">\r\n                          <img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"Node.js.png\">\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div class=\"col\">\r\n                          <img class=\"mt-5 img-fluid\" src=\"MongoDB.png\">\r\n                      </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n\r\n</style>","import { render } from \"./cder.vue?vue&type=template&id=ba61fb40\"\nimport script from \"./cder.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./cder.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Raelle Yann\\\\yannraelle.github.io\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader-v16\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
